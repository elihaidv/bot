The simulations  are trigger by rabbit.
Read from Firebase firestore.
Execution progress recorded in firestore at realtime.
Results are saved by CSV files in GCS.

In case you have to debug a simulation execution:
1. Make sure `tradevision.json` exsits. Else export it from `TRADEVISION_JSON` env variable
2. Use file `Simulator/local.ts` <simulation id> <variation> <start> <end>
You may disable or enable logging in this file.

You can use this service account to fetch firestore record for debugging.

The simulations results stored in GCS bucket:
`simulations-outputs/simulation${simulationId}-${variation}/${page}.csv`

If you need look old simulation executions for debugging, you can fetch the CSV files.
In case `trading-cloud.json`, you can export it  from `TRADINGCLOUD_JSON` env variable.
