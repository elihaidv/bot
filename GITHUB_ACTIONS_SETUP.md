# GitHub Actions Setup

This project has been converted from Bitbucket Pipelines to GitHub Actions. The workflow will automatically deploy to production on every push to the `master` or `firebase` branch.

## Required GitHub Secrets

You need to configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

### Deployment Secrets
1. **SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64**: Your SSH private key encoded in base64 for connecting to the deployment server
2. **DEPLOY_USER**: Username for SSH connection to the deployment server
3. **DEPLOY_HOST**: Hostname or IP address of the deployment server
4. **DEPLOY_PATH**: Path on the deployment server where the application should be deployed

### Database Configuration Secrets (Optional)
If your deployment server needs database configuration through environment variables:
5. **DB_USERNAME**: MongoDB username
6. **DB_PASSWORD**: MongoDB password  
7. **DB_ADDRESS**: MongoDB host and port (e.g., localhost:27017)
8. **DB_ENVIRONMENT**: Environment name (e.g., production, development)

## How to Set Up Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. In the left sidebar, click **Secrets and variables** â†’ **Actions**
4. Click **New repository secret** for each required secret
5. Add the secrets with the exact names listed above

## SSH Key Setup

1. Generate an SSH key pair if you don't have one:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email@example.com"
   ```

2. Add the public key to your deployment server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`:
   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@your-server
   ```

3. Add the base64 encoded private key content as the `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64` secret in GitHub:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa | base64 -w 0
   ```
   Copy the entire base64 output and paste it as the secret value.

## Workflow Details

The GitHub Action workflow:
- Runs on every push to the `master` or `firebase` branch
- Uses Ubuntu latest runner
- Sets up Node.js 22 with pnpm caching
- Installs project dependencies using pnpm
- Compiles TypeScript code with ES2020 target and ESNext modules
- Deploys to your server using rsync
- Installs dependencies on the server using npm
- Reloads the PM2 process

## Differences from Bitbucket Pipeline

- **Trigger**: Changed from `dev` branch to `master` and `firebase` branches
- **SSH Setup**: Uses GitHub's SSH agent action for secure key management
- **Known Hosts**: Automatically adds the deployment server to known hosts
- **Package Manager**: Uses pnpm for development dependencies and npm on server for consistency
- **Node.js Version**: Updated to Node.js 22 for better performance and latest features
- **Caching**: Added pnpm dependency caching for faster builds
- **Security**: Uses GitHub secrets instead of Bitbucket variables
- **TypeScript**: Improved compilation with modern ES2020 target and ESNext modules

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your SSH key has the correct permissions on the deployment server
- Verify the deployment path exists and is writable
- Check that PM2 and Node.js are installed and configured on the deployment server
- Ensure the deployment user has the necessary permissions
- If the action fails with SSH key errors, verify the private key is copied correctly (including BEGIN/END lines)
- For permission errors, ensure the deployment user can write to the specified path
